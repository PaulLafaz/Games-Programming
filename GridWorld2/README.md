# Grid World

Grid World is a CLI game we had to create in university that involves the user navigating the player through a maze
towards the end goal whilst avoiding death traps.

### Interesting Facts

* The start is represented with the capital letter S
* The player is represented with the capital letter P
* Death traps are represented with the capital letter D
* The goal is represented with the capital letter G
* The user can press the key Q to exit the game anytime.
* The grid is represented by the # symbol.
* Programmatically, the world is represented with the uses of a 2-dimentional array.
